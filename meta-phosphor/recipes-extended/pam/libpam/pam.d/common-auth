# /etc/pam.d/common-auth - authentication settings common to all services
#
# This file is included from other service-specific PAM config files,
# and should contain a list of the authentication modules that define
# the central authentication scheme for use on the system
# (e.g., /etc/shadow, LDAP, Kerberos, etc.).  The default is to use the
# traditional Unix authentication mechanisms.

# Note pam_faillock.so defaults to conf=/etc/security/faillock.conf

# here are the per-package modules (the "Primary" block)
# Try for local user first, and then try for ldap.
auth    [success=3 default=ignore]	pam_unix.so quiet
-auth   [success=2 default=ignore]  	pam_ldap.so ignore_unknown_user ignore_authinfo_unavail
# Control gets here when no authentication module succeeds.  Increment the
# failure tally and return failure status to PAM.
auth    [default=die]                   pam_faillock.so authfail
auth    requisite			pam_deny.so
# Control gets here when authentication succeeds.  Check if the user is locked
# out due to consecutive authentication failures and return status accordingly.
auth    required                        pam_faillock.so authsucc
# and here are more per-package modules (the "Additional" block)
